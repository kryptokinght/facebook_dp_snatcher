# Facebook dp snatcher
This is a nodejs script that requires the **nightmare** npm module.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/nightmare

In the file facebook.js you will find a lot of cryptic text. That's because i have encrypted my password and username in another file named ***fapx.txt*** and I am decrytping that file here using a key which is that cryptic text. You won't find that file here ;). 

In case you want to directly run the script use ***Facebook_simple.js***(remember to put your own username and password).

### Note: 
You cannot run this script on a cloud hosted IDE and make use
of their superfast internet connection to load all the Images at once.
BEACUSE facebook won't allow you to login from a different computer(in some other country).
Unless you find a way to open up facebook on the hosted computer and remove 
the temporary lockdown. Good Luck!
