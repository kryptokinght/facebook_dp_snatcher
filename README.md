#Facebook dp snatcher
For this you need the nightmare npm module. And also i have encrypted my password
and username in another file and named it ***fapx.txt***. You won't find that 
file here ;). In case you want to directly run the script use ***Facebook_simple.js***.
***Note***: You cannot run this script on a cloud hosted IDE and make use
of their superfast internet connection to load all the Images at once.
BEACUSE facebook won't allow to login from a different computer(in some other country).
Unless you find a way to open up facebook on the hosted computer and remove 
the temporary lockdown. Good Luck!
